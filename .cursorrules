# Project Standards
framework: "Next.js 15+ (App Router)"
language: "TypeScript"
styling: "Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI"
animations: "Framer Motion"

# Architectural Rules
- Use functional components with arrow function syntax.
- Prioritize interfaces over types for object definitions.
- Colocate route-specific components within the app directory using private folders (prefix with underscore, e.g., _components).
- Keep the /app directory clean for routing; extract business logic to /src/lib or /src/features.
- Ensure all UI is mobile-first and fully responsive.
